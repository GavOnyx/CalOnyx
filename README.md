# CalOnyx
A Calendar app inspired by the PMG app.

The PMG app is (for now) the best calendar/scheduling app out there, but it is unavailable to the public.
CalOnyx is meant to (eventually) match the PMG app in functionality and usability.

It is written in primarily in Python using the Kivy framework, and the KV language.
Kivy was chosen because of its relatively simple syntax, and its cross platform capabilities.
Data is stored using YAML.
